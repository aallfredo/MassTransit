MassTransit-PHP

This an attempt at Porting MassTransit to PHP started by forking the repo. The goal is to have crosscompatibility between the .net version and this one. Using the queues has IPC.

MassTransit is a _free, open-source_ distributed application framework for .NET. MassTransit makes it easy to create applications and services that leverage message-based, loosely-coupled asynchronous communication for higher availability, reliability, and scalability.
